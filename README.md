<strong> My name is Davide but you can call me Dave </strong> 

Hello everyone I am Davide and I am a student.<br>
I am studying to get a certificate as a Full Stack Developer.<br> 
Since I was little I have been used to deal with computers and during the years it has always been very easy for me to learn how to use new technologies.<br> 
As a self-taught I learned to use <em> PHOTOSHOP, ILLUSTRATOR, PREMIERE and FIGMA.</em><br>
For the past year I have been serving as a Server Manager in some Discord Servers. <br>
Besides computing my hobbies are : <strong> Web 3.0, music, sports and video games.</strong> <br>

Once I finish the course I would like to work in a company that makes web apps for web 3.0 and maybe even launch my own NFT project.
